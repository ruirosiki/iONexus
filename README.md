# iONexus

Welcome to iONexus. A web application for inventory and order management. This web application is a full-stack MERN app and is designed to help businesses manage available inventory, customer data, and place and track customer orders. Filtered inventory views allow users to view specific inventory categories for a quick glance of item availability and pricing. Customer lists allow the user to view all of their customers and update customer information or remove the customer.
